<p>The 32nd International Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information
Systems (JURIX 2019 <a href="https://jurix2019.oeg-upm.net/">https://jurix2019.oeg-upm.net/</a>) took place this
year in Madrid on December 11th-13th, organised by Universidad
Politécnica de Madrid (UPM). This conference gathers international
experts on Artificial Intelligence and Law, and language technologies
played a central role --law mostly consists of a body of written
documents. Together with the main conference, two side events where
organised --one convening the regtech industry, one convening experts on
NLP in the legal domain. Over 250 people were registered to these
events. In this second one, named "<em>IberLegal: NLP for Legal Domain in
Languages of the Iberian Peninsula</em>", Prêt-à-LLOD was verbally presented
before the poster was exhibited in the main conference hall (see photo
below). Call for Prêt-à-LLOD: there is a need for language resources in
the legal domain, especially for non-English languages.</p>
