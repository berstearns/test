      <p>Citizens and businesses of different nationalities often face barriers
when using digital tools and services. Consumers have restricted access
in some cases, and governments and citizens cannot fully benefit from
this digital transformation. The solution is the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Single_Market">digital single
market</a>, as it
removes key differences, breaking down the barriers to cross-border
online activity and providing
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilingualism">multilingual</a>
resources. </p>
<p>A coordinated, complementary, cross-border, and multilingual single
solution approach can play an important role not only in the digital
single market but also in disaster management. For example, the European
Union developed a common approach for efficient <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_20_670">contact tracing
apps</a>
to support the gradual lifting of confinement measures as a response to
the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic">Covid-19
pandemic</a>. Europes data
protection watchdog has called for a single coronavirus app to be used
across the multilingual EU nations, instead of every country making its
own. </p>
<p>The existing Google and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing">Natural Language
Processing</a>
(NLP) tools have several disadvantages over creating a digital single
market and well-coordinated multilingual solutions.
<a href="https://www.pret-a-llod.eu/tools-and-services/">Prêt-à-LLOD</a> tools, on
the other hand, utilize linked open data and language technologies to
create multilingual and cross-border applications.</p>
<p><strong>Why Prêt-à-LLOD tools?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Interlinked and interoperable information</strong></p>
<p>Google and Facebook provide very comfortable environments, precise
search results, autocomplete text boxes etc., but these tools are
developed on traditional databases (such as BI-tools, search engines,
etc) and these databases are not interlinked, although they are highly
related to each other. </p>
<p>For example, if a user wants to know about <em>Barack Obama</em> and searches
in Google tools, the results are obtained from the entire Internet as a
supplementary source. The results are merged, ranked and presented to
the user. To get more detail of personal information (such as birth date
and place, education, family, etc.) of <em>Barack Obama</em> and related
information (such as a predecessor, African American leaders, White
House, etc) users have to go through many documents and browse them.</p>
<p><img src="Obama-1024x551.png" alt="obama"></p>
<p>In google search, when searching <em>Barack Obama</em> a user has to go through
many documents to get related information (such as a predecessor, white
house,  etc).</p>
<p>On the other hand, if the data were stored or internally published as
Linked Data (as in the Prêt-à-LLOD linked data approach), the result
will expose all this personal information and also a list of related
entities, which are semantically interrelated to the users search query.
Exchangeability, interoperability, transformation, and linking are the
key to the development of linked data applications.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pret-a-llod.eu/software-and-resource-descriptions/">Prêt-à-LLOD provides several supporting
tools</a>
to develop linked data applications. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>A management tool for transforming, manipulating, enriching or
creating language resources. The tool converts data from any text
format to linked data format (i.e. <a href="https://www.w3.org/RDF/">RDF</a>)
and ensures exchangeability and interoperability among databases and
services.</li>
<li>Linking components to link databases and resources by linking a term
to another term (i.e apple is linked to orange), a term to a concept
(i.e. apple to linked to fruit), and a concept to another concept of
a knowledge base (i.e. <a href="https://wiki.dbpedia.org/">DBpedia</a>).</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../static/Obama-Bush-613x1024.png" alt=""></p>
<p>An <a href="https://doi.org/10.1007/s11042-011-0733-1">application</a> developed on
linked data, the search result can provide a list of related entities,
which are interrelated to the users search query. As can be seen from
the figure, Barack Obama is linked with George W. Bush.</p>
<p><strong>Multilingual information and complex translation</strong>: </p>
<p>Most of these NLP tools are developed without considering their usage in
multilingual settings. Although Google Translate can be a lifesaver when
we need to translate simple text (such as a menu in a foreign language),
when translating financial reports, educational materials,
health-related documents, pharmaceutical drug trials, Google Translate
is unlikely to interpret original ideas and provide an accurate
translation. </p>
<p>The Prêt-à-LLOD tools provide a multilingual cross-repository data
search facility, covering major dataset sources across Europe and the
world. Through these tools, terms (or pieces of text) are exposed as
multilingual data (translations, definitions, synonyms and other
terminological data). Therefore, users can navigate from one translation
to the other in a specific language by simply clicking the information.
 </p>
<p><strong>Cross-border information access and licensing</strong>: </p>
<p>The Google translation service platforms are not ideal where
confidential documents are involved. Some companies have found that
their <a href="https://qz.com/1075524/if-you-value-your-privacy-be-careful-with-online-translation-tools/">confidential data was published
online</a>
after they had used online translation tools to translate company data. </p>
<p>Prêt-à-LLOD provides new models and mechanisms for ensuring the ​
validity​, ​ maintainability and ​ licensing of language resources and
tools to deduce the possible licenses of a resource.</p>
